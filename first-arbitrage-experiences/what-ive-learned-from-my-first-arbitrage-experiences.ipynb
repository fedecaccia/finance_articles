    "A lot of posts have been coming up talking about how traders get rich from arbitrage opportunities in the crypto market. I was trying to arbitrage for months, but I could never get a profitable strategy, so I tell you the common problems I found there, and they might be helpful for those who are starting with this, so you don't have to travel the same painful path. Summarizing, what I found:\n",
    "* Most of the arbitrage opportunities disspear after considering exchanges fees and commissions\n",
    "* Most of arbitrage opportunities appear between exchanges with maintenance wallets, what makes deposits or withdrawls imposibles.\n",
    "* Transaction times between exchanges cause arbitrage to become a lottery due to market volatility.\n",

    "[Arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets. For example, if you find that stocks from some company are traded at lower price in some market that in others, then you can buy that stocks at that market, and sell them in other markets, at higher price, taking a profit from the price difference. Simple. Unfortunatly, too simply.\n",
    "\n",
    "That simplicity gives many traders the opportunity to take advantage of the situation, and this way, increasing the demand of the stocks in markets where prices are lower and the same time increasing the offer in markets with higher prices. So,  unintentionally, they stabilize price inequality, decreasing the opportunities. And, more traders on a market, more *efficiciently* they work to stabilize the prices. In fact, finance models assume an [arbitrage-free](https://www.glynholton.com/notes/arbitrage-free-pricing/) condition, which implies that, in efficient markets, there are not arbitrage opportunities right there waiting for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, let's be honest, cryto assets markets are realtively green. There are constantly appearing new exchanges with low trading volumnes. This market is far from being efficient."

To do this, let's use the [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) python library which allows us to connect to several exchanges (currently, 115) and trade cryptos in an standarized way (ccxt developers, you have really done a great job).
